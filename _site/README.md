This is a Jekyll version of the theme Helios: http://html5up.net/helios

You can check the build here: http://kaira.one/helios_jekyll

Unlike the original theme, users can change the content of the "Post" and "Article" directly under the _post directory. You can add as many posts you want, and you can even change the image by inputting a different file picture. All you have to do is create a new post with the proper file heading: ```YEAR-MM-DD-FILENAME.markdown``` and include this on the header.
